# MacOS Setup

This repository uses Ansible to configure a new Mac from scratch with some helpful defaults meant to save time. It's an amalgamation of [@jamesreggio](https://github.com/jamesreggio/dotfiles)'s solution and [another solution](https://github.com/TalkingQuickly/ansible-osx-setup) I found online.

## How to install

Run:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulmichalak/osx-setup/master/bootstrap.sh | sh
```
